# Parallels

## Task 1

1. There are two very long vectors, 10,000 long, A and B. They are filled with integer elements.Add the two vectors coordinately. You can create two processes, one works with one half of the vectors, the other with the other half. Do a timestamp afterward.

2. Scalar product of 2 vectors. Measure the running time of the program.

3. Multiplication of square matrices. Measure the running time of the program.

## Task 2

To find out whether the graph is isomorphic or not.

## Task 3

Solving systems of linear equations (by any method). For example, Gauss method or other methods.

## Task 4

By means of OMP parallelize the process of finding the inverse matrix. Find out the efficiency of work.

## Task 5

1. An ordinary graph is given: K- (3n/4 random edges are removed from a complete graph of n vertices).
Efficiently parallelize using thread threads and other low-level tools to solve the problem "Calculating the graph diameter".

2. Geophysical methods can be used to search for mineral deposits in the Earth's interior. On a given surface area of m x m kilometers, 10 km deep, find a gas-bearing deposit and calculate its volume.

## Task 6

1. Obtaining the matrix Z of distances between vertices of a graph by its incident matrix B. Compare the efficiency of OMP, PPL, AMP.

2. Create a classic Windows application in Visual Studio. Using WinAPI, describe and show in a window the parallel processes in the following task:
Shuttle (airport bus). It travels along a closed route (4 stops). At each stop some people get off (random number). At each stop there is a queue of passengers of random length. Shuttle picks up people to free seats, rides on. Unlimited.
Include in the description the output in a graphical window on the screen of the states of graphical objects of the task with a frequency of at least 30 frames per second.

3. Create a classic Windows application in Visual Studio. Using WinAPI, describe and show in a window the parallel processes in the following task:
Defender. A computer process simulates a striker who wants to score a goal. A second computer process simulates the goalkeeper. The closer the striker gets to the goal, the more likely the goalkeeper will fail. The person at the keyboard (or mouse) simulates the defender trying to take the ball away from the attacker.
Include in the description the output in a graphical window on the screen of the states of the graphical objects of the task with a frequency of at least 30 frames per second.

## Task 7

1. Write a program that computes the "next prime number" on a given prime number n, i.e., finds such a prime number k > n that all numbers between k and n are composite. Use assembler inserts.

2. Write a program to calculate the value of F(x) of the function of the standard normal distribution of a random variable (Gaussian distribution) based on the formula for decomposition into a power series multiplied by a quadratic exponent. Use assembler inserts.
